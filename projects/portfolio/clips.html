            <li>I wrote an opinion piece on the state of player safety in the NFL - linking it to Aaron Rodgers'
                Achilles
                tear as a concrete consequence of neglecting player needs. Player injuries happen far too often in the
                NFL,
                and while there are easy methods to lessen occurrences, the monetary consequence of those paths prevents
                billion-dollar industries from going down them.</li>

            <li>I interviewed a local chainsaw artist and wrote a profile story on him, gathering his life story and
                getting it published in the Greater Olney News. I created this piece for my news writing class - but had
                a blast doing it. The chainsaw artist had an incredibly interesting story to tell.</li>

            <li>The first of two major videography projects - the second being the holiday festival. I
                attended a local Brazilian-themed dancing class, shooting and editing together a video to capture the
                atmosphere and environment of the class. Interviewing students and teachers was a blast.</li>

            <li>I shot footage at a local holiday breakfast at an assisted living home - and then edited the clips
                together
                with Adobe Premiere Pro. I interviewed three different people and got a variety of shots for my piece.
