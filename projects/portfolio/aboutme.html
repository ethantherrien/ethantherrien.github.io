            <p>Journalism student at the University of Maryland in College Park, set to graduate in 2025. Avid writer
                and sports junkie, with dreams of entering the sports writing industry and combining the two passions. I
                also have a concrete interest in news writing - with a prospective dabble in news videography and
                editing due to experience shooting and editing videos with broadcast cameras and Adobe Premiere Pro. I
                will not shy away from opportunities involving either field in any regard; my time on campus has
                certainly gifted me a wide variety of journalistic interests. I operate as a freelance writer for the
                Greater Olney News in my free time, gathering writing, reporting and interviewing experience by the
                week. I would like to expand that experience and apply it to professional writing on a larger scale.</p>
