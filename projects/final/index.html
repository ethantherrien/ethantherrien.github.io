        <h1>The Numbers and Nuances Behind the Patriots' Dynasty</h1>

        <div class="container">
            <p>The New England Patriots enjoyed one of the most dominant stretches of consistent winning in NFL history
                from 2000-2019.</p>
            <img src="images/Image4.png" alt="chart1" class="img-fluid">
            <p>From 2001 to 2019, New England won an astounding 76.3% of their regular season games, giving them an
                average of 12 wins per season. Their playoff success was arguably even more impressive - with an 80% win
                rate in the first and second round, the Patriots
                were essentially a lock to make the Conference Championship game every single year. At one point, New
                England made an NFL record eight straight conference title games from 2011-2018. </p>

                <h2>The Coach</h2>
                <p>The dynasty sparked in 2000, when the Patriots traded a first-round draft pick to the Jets in
                    exchange
                    for head coach Bill Belichick – who would become one
                    of two main figureheads of the two decades of success that followed. The Belichick hiring provided a
                    foundation and stable voice
                    for a franchise that had long lacked a general direction or culture, being the laughingstock of the
                    league for most of the 1900s. It was not long until Belichick assumed the role of general manager as
                    well, using his ability to efficiently and effectively handle the team’s finances and
                    draft choices to sustain perpetual success for the following 20 years.
                </p>
                <img src="images/BelichickLegacyRework_Feat_Getty_Ringer.jpg" alt="bill" class="img-fluid">
                <p>Belichick had an legendary track record as a general manager for most of his career – statistics show
                    that his ability to find gems with mid to late round draft picks was consistently near the top of
                    the
                    league.
                    Even more impressively, Belichick had the infamous ability to acquire players that other teams gave
                    up
                    on
                    – developing players that most people thought were in the twilight of their careers into legitimate
                    contributers, and even stars. As the old saying goes, one man’s trash is another man’s
                    treasure. Belichick was able to adopt this motto at an incredible, consistent clip. Every year for
                    most
                    of his tenure, he would draft future
                    stars out of traditional powerhouse schools in states like Texas, Florida, California and Georgia,
                    but
                    also
                    possessed an all-time ability to pull absolute gems out of small schools less known for their
                    football
                    programs like Rutgers, Kent State and Louisville.</p>

            <h2>The Quarterback</h2>
            <p>But Belichick’s greatest draft steal and accomplishment as the Patriots’ kingpin was undoubtedly
                the 199th pick of the 2000 NFL Draft – a 6th round pick that Bill Belichick used to take Michigan
                Quarterback Tom Brady. Seen as the greatest draft steal in American sports history, Brady’s rise
                from
                6th round afterthought to greatest football player of all time – coupled with Belichick’s wizardry
                as a
                head
                coach created an absolute buzzsaw of a “power couple” that had the Patriots at or
                near the top of the league for two decades. </p>
            <img src="images/c86a0285763628f4f09312b48bf7f0d2_crop_exact.jpg" alt="card" class="img-fluid">
            <p>Brady began his rookie training camp as the number four quarterback on the Patriots' depth chart,
                facing
                a steep uphill battle to playing time and even making the team - always staring a termination of his
                contract right in the eyes.
                However, consistent play on the practice field allowed him to work his way up the ranks and an
                unfortunate, near fatal injury to starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe thrust Brady into the starting
                position - a job he took, ran with and never gave back.</p>
            <img src="images/12720-tom-brady-drew-bledsoe.webp" alt="quarterbacks" class="img-fluid">
            <p>Brady went on to shatter nearly every quarterback record there is to shatter - winning six Super
                Bowls
                with the Patriots and one with the Buccaneers late in his career
                in the process. His consistent Hall of Fame level play year after year ensured that the Patriots
                would
                be a double digit win team and Super Bowl contender regardless of the roster quality surrounding
                him.
                Brady had a knack for elevating players around him - turning middling receivers struggling to make a
                name for themselves into legitimate starting receivers through his exceptional quarterback play.
            </p>
            <p>The Patriots had their struggles - it was not exactly a plethora of endless championships during the
                two
                decade long run. A ten year stretch from 2004-2014 where they failed to win a championship serves as
                a
                blemish on the teams otherwise loaded resume, losing two to the New York Giants in the process. But
                Brady's dominance and
                consistency kept them in contention for a title year after year after year.</p>

                <h2>Late Round Success</h2>
                <p>Belichick had a number of famous late round steals - but his selection of Kent State Quarterback
                    Julian
                    Edelman in the 7th round of the 2009 NFL Draft turned into one of the greatest draft stories of all
                    time.
                    Edelman was a lifelong quarterback who had never played wide receiver a day in his life, but was
                    converted to wide receiver post-draft. Belichick’s coaching, development and eye for late-round
                    talent went on to turn a kid
                    unfamiliar with the receiver position pre-professional level into a future Super Bowl MVP,
                    perennial producer and one of the key cogs of New England’s dynasty.</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-6">

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Edelman served as New England's primary slot receiver and consistent 3rd down chain mover for
                    the
                    next 11 seasons, making multiple fourth quarter, championship winning catches. He retired in
                    2021 after chronic knee injuries diminished his ability to run consistently.</p>
