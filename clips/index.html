                    Piece on NFL Player Safety</a></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I wrote an opinion piece on the state of player safety in the NFL - linking it to Aaron Rodgers'
                    Achilles
                    tear as a concrete consequence of neglecting player needs. Player injuries happen far too often in
                    the
                    NFL,
                    and while there are easy methods to lessen occurrences, the monetary consequence of those paths
                    prevents
                    billion-dollar industries from going down them.</li>

                    Story on a Local Chainsaw Artist</a></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I interviewed a local chainsaw artist and wrote a profile story on him, gathering his life story and
                    getting it published in the Greater Olney News. I created this piece for my news writing class - but
                    had
                    a blast doing it. The chainsaw artist had an incredibly interesting story to tell.</li>

                    Panhandling Story</a></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>My first ever published work - I attended a local police meeting for business owners, listened,
                    gathered
                    quotes, and wrote a story for the Greater Olney News.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The first of two major videography projects - the second being the holiday festival. I
                    attended a local Brazilian-themed dancing class, shooting and editing together a video to capture the
                    atmosphere and environment of the class. Interviewing students and teachers was a blast.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><a href="https://vimeo.com/892779759?share=copy">Holiday Festival - Breakfast with Santa</a></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I shot footage at a local holiday breakfast at an assisted living home - and then edited the clips
                    together
                    with Adobe Premiere Pro. I interviewed three different people and got a variety of shots for my piece.
